## 🔍 Why "Anyone"?

**Don't worry - your data is still secure!**

- "Anyone" means: *Anyone with the URL can access it*
- Your URL is long and secret (impossible to guess)
- Only people you share the URL with can access your data
- This is **standard for Google Apps Script Web Apps**
- Your Google account still controls everything

**Current setting** probably says:
- "Only myself" ❌ (blocks everyone including your dashboard)
- "Anyone within [your domain]" ❌ (blocks external domains like Vercel)

**Correct setting:**
- "Anyone" ✅ (allows your dashboard to connect)

---

## 🧪 Test It Worked:

### Method 1: Dashboard Banner
- Go to your dashboard
- Look for green banner saying: **"✅ Connected to Google Apps Script successfully"**

### Method 2: Test Tool
1. Open: `test-api-connection.html` (in your project folder)
2. Paste your Google Apps Script URL
3. Click **"Test Connection"**
4. Should see: **"✅ Connection Successful!"**

### Method 3: Browser Console
1. Press **F12** (open DevTools)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for:
   ```
   ✅ API Response: { students: Array(125) }
   ```
4. **No CORS errors** should appear

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Problem: "I don't see 'Manage deployments'"
**Solution:** You need to deploy first!
1. Click **"Deploy"** → **"New deployment"**
2. Select type: **"Web app"**
3. Set **"Who has access"** to **"Anyone"**
4. Click **"Deploy"**

### Problem: "I changed it but still get CORS error"
**Solution:** Clear your browser cache
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**
2. Select **"Cached images and files"**
3. Click **"Clear data"**
4. Or just press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (hard refresh)

### Problem: "I see 'Authorization required'"
**Solution:**
1. When deploying, make sure **"Execute as"** is set to **"Me"**
2. Click **"Authorize access"** and approve the permissions
3. Then deploy again

### Problem: "Wrong URL in my dashboard"
**Your URL in code:**
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxSawbi4f370i94rPA2EpVZh3LlfMisq7uu6r3pS0Q3rQU8nW5qTk_Witm1FVd5kQtb/exec
```

**If this is NOT your URL:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add: `VITE_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` = [Your correct URL]
4. Redeploy

## ✨ After It Works:
