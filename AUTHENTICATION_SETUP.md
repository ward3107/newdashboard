## üöÄ Next Steps (What YOU Need to Do)

### Step 1: Set Up Firebase (15-20 minutes)

1. **Follow the detailed guide:**
   ```
   Read: docs/FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   ```

2. **Quick checklist:**
   - [ ] Create Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
   - [ ] Enable Email/Password authentication
   - [ ] Enable Google Sign-In authentication
   - [ ] Create Firestore database
   - [ ] Set up security rules
   - [ ] Get your Firebase configuration

### Step 2: Create .env File (2 minutes)

1. **Copy the example file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` and paste your Firebase config:**
   ```bash
   nano .env
   # or
   code .env
   ```

3. **Replace these values** with your actual Firebase configuration:
   ```bash
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_actual_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789012
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789012:web:abcdef1234567890
   ```

### Step 3: Create Your First User (5 minutes)

Since this is a fresh system, you need to create the first user manually:

#### Option A: Using Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
2. Click "Add user"
3. Enter email: `admin@yourschool.com`
4. Enter password: `YourSecurePassword123!`
5. Click "Add user"
6. Note the UID (e.g., `abc123xyz`)

7. Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Start collection:
   - Collection ID: `users`
   - Document ID: (paste the UID from step 6)
   - Fields:
     ```
     email: admin@yourschool.com
     displayName: Admin User
     role: super_admin
     schoolId: demo-school
     isActive: true
     createdAt: (click "timestamp" and use "now")
     ```
   - Click "Save"

8. Create a school document:
   - Collection ID: `schools`
   - Document ID: `demo-school`
   - Fields:
     ```
     name: Demo School
     subscriptionStatus: active
     subscriptionTier: premium
     maxTeachers: 50
     maxStudents: 1000
     adminEmail: admin@yourschool.com
     isActive: true
     createdAt: (timestamp - now)
     ```

#### Option B: Using Firebase CLI (Advanced)

I can create a script for this if needed - just let me know!

### Step 4: Test the Authentication (5 minutes)

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the flow:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:5173`
   - You should be redirected to `/login`
   - Try logging in with the credentials you created
   - You should be redirected to the dashboard

3. **Test password reset:**
   - Click "Forgot password?"
   - Enter your email
   - Check your inbox for reset email

4. **Test Google Sign-In:**
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - **Note:** This will fail if user doesn't exist in Firestore - you need to create them first

## üìä User Roles & Permissions

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Once you complete the setup, test these scenarios:

### Authentication Tests:
- [ ] Can login with email/password
- [ ] Can login with Google
- [ ] Cannot login with wrong password
- [ ] Cannot login with unverified email
- [ ] Can reset password
- [ ] Can logout

### Authorization Tests:
- [ ] Cannot access dashboard without login
- [ ] Teacher only sees their students
- [ ] School admin sees all school students
- [ ] Super admin sees everything
- [ ] Cannot access admin panel as teacher

### UI Tests:
- [ ] Login page looks good on mobile
- [ ] Forms show validation errors
- [ ] Loading states work correctly
- [ ] Error messages are clear

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Firebase configuration missing" error
- **Cause:** `.env` file not created or variables not set
- **Fix:** Create `.env` file and add your Firebase config

### "User data not found" error
- **Cause:** User exists in Firebase Auth but not in Firestore
- **Fix:** Create user document in Firestore (see Step 3)

### "Email not verified" error
- **Cause:** User hasn't verified their email
- **Fix:** Check email inbox or verify manually in Firebase Console

### Login button does nothing
- **Cause:** Form validation errors or network issues
- **Fix:** Open browser console (F12) to see error messages

### Google Sign-In popup blocked
- **Cause:** Browser is blocking popups
- **Fix:** Allow popups for localhost in browser settings

### Cannot see students after login
- **Cause:** No students assigned to teacher
- **Fix:** Assign students to teacher in Firestore (we'll add admin UI for this)

   - School-level data isolation
   - Subdomain routing (optional)

4. **Add Payment System**
   - Stripe integration
   - Subscription management
   - Access control based on payment

5. **Add Parent Portal**
