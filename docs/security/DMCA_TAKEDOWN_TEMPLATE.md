## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Considerations

### DMCA Safe Harbor:

Platforms like GitHub must:
1. Remove infringing content when notified
2. Forward your notice to the infringer
3. The infringer can file a counter-notice

### Counter-Notice:

If the infringer files a counter-notice claiming fair use or
authorization, you may need to:
1. File a lawsuit within 10-14 days, OR
2. Accept the counter-notice

**Recommendation:** Consult with a lawyer if you receive a counter-notice.

### Criminal Copyright Infringement:

In some jurisdictions, willful copyright infringement for commercial
advantage can be a criminal offense. Contact law enforcement if:
- Large-scale commercial infringement
- Significant financial harm
- Repeated violations after takedown
