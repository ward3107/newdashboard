## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If You Discover a Secret Was Committed to Git:

1. **Immediately rotate the compromised secret** (new API key, password, etc.)
2. **Remove from git history:**
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/secret/file" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```
3. **Force push** (if repository is not public or you control all forks)
4. **Notify affected parties** if data breach occurred
5. **Document the incident**

### If You Discover Unauthorized Use:

1. **Document everything** (screenshots, URLs, dates)
2. **Email:** wardwas3107@gmail.com with subject `[VIOLATION]`
3. **File DMCA takedown** if hosted on GitHub/GitLab
4. **Consider legal action** based on severity

### If You Discover a Security Vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT commit the fix publicly** before notification
2. **Document the vulnerability** (impact, reproduction steps)
3. **Email:** wardwas3107@gmail.com with subject `[SECURITY]`
4. **Wait for response** before public disclosure
5. **Coordinate fix and disclosure** with owner

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools & Commands

### Audit Commands
```bash
# Check for secrets in codebase
npm run security:audit

# Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
npm audit

# Check for high/critical vulnerabilities only
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Fix vulnerabilities automatically
npm audit fix

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Check git history for sensitive files
git log --all --full-history -- '*.env' '.env.*' '*.key' '*.pem'

# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|api_key" src/ --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"
```

### Pre-Commit Hook
Install the pre-commit hook to automatically check for secrets:
```bash
cp scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
