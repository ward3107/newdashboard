# üî¨ AI Model Comparison Framework - Which Produces Better Analysis?

## Your Question

> "How can we know what is better from the analysis aspect?"

This guide provides a **systematic framework** to objectively compare analysis quality between different AI models (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5, etc.)

---

## The Problem

You can't judge analysis quality just by reading it because:

1. **Subjective bias** - You might prefer longer/shorter responses
2. **Recency bias** - The last one you read seems better
3. **Confirmation bias** - You see what you expect to see
4. **Lacks standards** - No objective criteria to measure against

**Solution:** Use a structured evaluation rubric with measurable criteria.

---

## üìä Quick Comparison Method (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Pick ONE Test Student

Choose a student with:

- ‚úÖ Complete form responses (all questions answered)
- ‚úÖ Mixed performance (not all good or all bad)
- ‚úÖ Clear patterns in their answers

**Example:** Student 70101 who has both strengths and challenges

### Step 2: Analyze with Multiple Models

Run the SAME student through 3 models:

```javascript
// In Google Apps Script, change line 59 and re-analyze:

// Test 1:
OPENAI_MODEL: "gpt-4o-mini",

// Test 2:
OPENAI_MODEL: "gpt-5-nano",

// Test 3:
OPENAI_MODEL: "gpt-5-mini",
```

**IMPORTANT:** Delete the previous analysis from AI_Insights sheet before each test, so you get fresh results.

### Step 3: Compare Using This Checklist

Print this checklist and score each model (1-5 scale):

```
STUDENT CODE: _______

CRITERION 1: INSIGHT RELEVANCE
‚ñ° Are insights directly based on the student's actual answers?
‚ñ° Do insights match what you know about this student?
‚ñ° Are insights specific (not generic advice)?

Score: ___/5

CRITERION 2: EVIDENCE QUALITY
‚ñ° Does each insight cite specific questions from the form?
‚ñ° Are patterns identified correctly?
‚ñ° Is evidence concrete (not vague)?

Score: ___/5

CRITERION 3: RECOMMENDATION PRACTICALITY
‚ñ° Can you implement these recommendations tomorrow?
‚ñ° Are recommendations specific (not "encourage student")?
‚ñ° Do recommendations match the evidence?

Score: ___/5

CRITERION 4: ACCURACY
‚ñ° No contradictions in the analysis?

## üß™ Scientific Testing Protocol

For maximum objectivity, follow this protocol:

### Phase 1: Preparation (5 minutes)

1. **Select 3 test students** with different profiles:
   - Student A: High performer (mostly strengths)
   - Student B: Struggling student (mostly challenges)
   - Student C: Mixed profile (balanced)

2. **Prepare comparison spreadsheet:**

   ```
   Student | Model | Insight Quality | Recommendations | Accuracy | Total
   70101   | mini  | ?              | ?               | ?        | ?
   70101   | nano  | ?              | ?               | ?        | ?
   70101   | 5-mini| ?              | ?               | ?        | ?
   70102   | mini  | ?              | ?               | ?        | ?
   ...
   ```

### Phase 2: Analysis Generation (15 minutes)

For each student √ó model combination:

1. **Update CONFIG in Google Apps Script:**

   ```javascript
   OPENAI_MODEL: "gpt-4o-mini",  // or gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-mini, etc.
   ```

2. **Clear previous analysis:**
   - Open AI_Insights sheet
   - Delete the row for this student (keep header)

3. **Run analysis:**
   - In Google Apps Script: `analyzeOneStudent("70101")`
   - Wait for completion (3-5 seconds)

4. **Save results:**
   - Copy the analysis to a separate document
   - Label it clearly: "Student 70101 - gpt-4o-mini"

### Phase 3: Blind Evaluation (30 minutes)

**IMPORTANT:** Randomize the order so you don't know which model produced which analysis!

1. **Rename files randomly:**

   ```
   Student 70101 - gpt-4o-mini  ‚Üí  Student 70101 - Analysis A
   Student 70101 - gpt-5-nano   ‚Üí  Student 70101 - Analysis B
   Student 70101 - gpt-5-mini   ‚Üí  Student 70101 - Analysis C
   ```

2. **Evaluate each analysis** using the detailed rubric above

3. **Don't compare while evaluating** - score each one independently

4. **Record scores** in your spreadsheet

### Phase 4: Analysis (10 minutes)

1. **Reveal which model is which**

2. **Calculate average scores:**

   ```
   gpt-4o-mini:  (Student A score + Student B score + Student C score) / 3 = ?
   gpt-5-nano:   (Student A score + Student B score + Student C score) / 3 = ?
   gpt-5-mini:   (Student A score + Student B score + Student C score) / 3 = ?
   ```

3. **Check consistency:**
   - Did one model consistently score higher across all students?
   - Or were results mixed?

4. **Consider cost vs quality:**
   - Is the higher-scoring model worth the extra cost?
   - What's the cost difference for 29 students?

## üìã Real-World Quality Indicators

Beyond scores, look for these **practical signs of quality**:

### ‚úÖ Signs of GOOD Analysis

1. **Specific Evidence**
   - ‚ùå "Student struggles with focus"
   - ‚úÖ "Student reports difficulty concentrating during long lectures (Q8) and prefers short, interactive tasks (Q16)"

2. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - ‚ùå "Encourage the student"
   - ‚úÖ "Implement Pomodoro technique: 25-minute work blocks with 5-minute breaks, using a visual timer app"

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - ‚ùå Lists random observations
   - ‚úÖ Connects multiple answers to identify a learning style

4. **Balance**
   - ‚ùå Only lists problems
   - ‚úÖ Highlights 4-6 strengths AND 2-3 challenges

5. **No Contradictions**
   - ‚ùå "Student is highly motivated" + "Student lacks motivation"
   - ‚úÖ "Student is motivated by hands-on activities but less so by theoretical concepts"

6. **Teacher-Ready**
   - ‚ùå Requires you to interpret or translate
   - ‚úÖ Can copy-paste into an email to parents

### ‚ùå Signs of POOR Analysis

1. **Generic Advice**
   - "Every student is unique"
   - "Provide encouragement and support"
   - "Use various teaching methods"

2. **Contradictions**
   - Says student is visual learner, then recommends audio resources

3. **Unsupported Claims**
   - Makes assertions without citing which questions reveal this

4. **Missing Key Patterns**
   - Student answered "I hate group work" 5 times, but analysis doesn't mention collaboration challenges

5. **Impractical Recommendations**
   - "Provide one-on-one tutoring every day" (unrealistic)
   - "Redesign the entire curriculum" (not actionable)

---

## üéì Case Study: Example Comparison

Let's compare three analyses of the SAME student to show what "better" looks like:

### Student 70101 Form Responses (Summary)

- Q4: "I find it hard to focus during long lectures"
- Q6: "I prefer visual diagrams over text"
- Q9: "I don't like working in groups"
- Q17: "I struggle with time management"
- Q25: "I'm proud of my problem-solving skills"

---

### Analysis A (Poor Quality - Score: 45/100)

**Insight 1: Learning Challenges**
The student faces some learning challenges that need attention.

**Recommendation:**

- Provide support
- Encourage the student
- Monitor progress

**Why it's poor:**

- ‚ùå Vague ("some challenges")
- ‚ùå No evidence cited
- ‚ùå Generic recommendations
- ‚ùå Not actionable

---

### Analysis B (Good Quality - Score: 75/100)

**Insight 1: Visual Learning Preference**
Evidence: Q6 (prefers diagrams over text)
Pattern: Student is a visual learner

**Recommendations:**

- Use visual aids in lessons
- Provide diagram-based notes
- Encourage mind-mapping

**Why it's good:**

- ‚úÖ Cites specific question
- ‚úÖ Clear pattern identified
- ‚úÖ Actionable recommendations
- ‚úÖ Matches evidence

**But missing:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't connect to focus issues (Q4)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't address time management (Q17)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could be more specific ("Use visual aids" - which ones?)

---

### Analysis C (Excellent Quality - Score: 95/100)

**Insight 1: Visual-Spatial Learning Strength with Attention Considerations**

**Evidence Chain:**

- Q6: Prefers visual diagrams over text
- Q4: Difficulty focusing during long lectures (passive, auditory learning)
- Q25: Strong problem-solving skills (visual-spatial reasoning)

**Pattern Analysis:**
This student processes information most effectively through visual channels. The reported focus difficulties during lectures likely stem from a mismatch between learning style (visual) and teaching method (auditory). The strong problem-solving skills suggest high visual-spatial intelligence.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate (Week 1-2): Visual Note-Taking System**
   - Provide Cornell note template with visual column
   - Teach sketchnoting basics (Mike Rohde method)
   - Allow student to draw diagrams during lectures
   - **Expected outcome:** Improved focus during lectures by 30%

2. **Short-term (Month 1): Visual Scaffolding**
   - Pre-provide visual outlines before lectures
   - Use concept mapping for complex topics
   - Introduce digital tools: Coggle, MindMeister
   - **Expected outcome:** Student creates 2+ visual study aids per week

3. **Medium-term (Quarter 1): Leverage Problem-Solving Strength**
   - Assign visual problem-solving challenges
   - Encourage peer tutoring using visual explanations
   - Provide advanced visual-spatial puzzles
   - **Expected outcome:** Increased engagement and confidence

**Why it's excellent:**

- ‚úÖ Cites multiple questions
- ‚úÖ Connects patterns (visual learning + focus issues)
- ‚úÖ Explains WHY the pattern exists
- ‚úÖ Specific, time-bound recommendations
- ‚úÖ Includes expected outcomes
- ‚úÖ Builds on strengths (problem-solving)
- ‚úÖ Addresses challenges (focus)
