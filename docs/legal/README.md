## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **"School says your privacy policy is too long"**
**Solution:** Create a 1-page summary:
- What we collect: Questionnaire responses
- What we don't collect: ID numbers, addresses
- Where it's stored: Israel/EU
- Who sees it: Only your teachers
- How to delete: Email us anytime

### **"School wants American company (not Israeli)"**
**Response:**
- ISHEBOT complies with same standards as American companies (GDPR, SOC 2)
- Israeli company = easier support (same timezone, language, culture)
- Data stays in Israel (data sovereignty - actually better than USA)

### **"School lawyer says they need their own DPA template"**
**Solution:**
- Ask for their template
- Compare to our DPA
- Merge the two (accept their language if it doesn't hurt you)
- Final review by both sides

### **"School asks: 'Are you ISO 27001 certified?'"**
**Answer:**
- "We align with ISO 27001 standards and are working toward full certification"
- "Our infrastructure (Google Cloud) is fully ISO 27001 certified"
- "We can provide current compliance documentation"
